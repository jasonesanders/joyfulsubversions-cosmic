# Jason Sanders

Jason is curious, sharp, and not afraid to rethink how to do things. He knows people, not just process. He has built some great stuff. He has also learned a few things the hard way, and is better for it. He can teach, he can execute, and he has a keen eye.

## About

He has hung from the landing gear of a helicopter at golden hour to snap the perfect sunset shot for a client, led a major university's global digital campaign strategy to 10x success, grown 3 separate marketing teams in 3 different industries, and developed and deployed end-to-end analytics, CRMs, CMSes, attribution models, data warehouses, and more.

He enjoys experimenting, collaborating and improving. Bringing something to fruition is a beautiful process and it’s even better when it’s achieved alongside others; which it usually is.
